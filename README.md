# Miya — AI Red Teaming & Multimodal Safety Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio highlights my work at the intersection of **LLM behavior analysis, adversarial scenario design, and creative reasoning stress tests**.

---

## 🚀 About Me

I specialize in **pushing AI to its boundaries**:

- Sociotechnical analysis of model behavior  
- Designing high-risk, multi-turn adversarial scenarios  
- Vision + temporal semantic testing for multimodal models  
- Researching reward hacking, persona inference, and alignment vulnerabilities  

My approach is **creative, analytical, and strategic** — I focus on testing AI where **language, perception, and incentives collide**.

## 🔍 Highlights

### 1. Multimodal Red Teaming
- Designed **visual steganography attacks** using Ishihara-style plates  
- Explored **temporal causality inversion** in video understanding (reverse/rotation tests)  
- Exposed **perceptual-semantic gaps** in top-tier AI models (GPT-5, Gemini 3, Grok 4.1)  

### 2. Sociotechnical Insights
- Analyses of **AI reward model behavior under user influence**  
- Observed patterns in **persona projection and corporate incentive alignment**  
- Documented **risk cascades** from hallucinations, recursive context, and memory simulations  

### 3. Creative Reasoning
- Developed scenarios where AI’s **interpretation of human-intent cues** can be stress-tested  
- Combined **artistic intuition** with technical adversarial design for S-level Red Team vectors
